\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Methods such as support vector machines \citep{Mountrakis2011}, random forests \citep{Belgiu2016}, and deep learning \citep{Ma2019} have become the popular for remote sensing image classification. These classifiers use training samples derived from ``pure'' pixels that users have selected to represent the desired output classes. However, images contain many mixed pixels irrespective of the resolution. Also, there is a considerable degree of data variability in each class. Therefore, images resulting from these classifiers frequently have outliers or misclassified pixels. For this reason, image post-processing techniques are widely used to refine the labelling in a classified image in order to enhance its classification accuracy \citep{Huang2014}.

Post-processing plays a significant role in remote sensing image classification. One key contribution is reducing the salt-and-pepper effect, a phenomenon where single pixels or small groups of pixels are classified differently from their larger surrounding areas, which can lead to visual discontinuity and inconsistency in the output. As a result, the quality of the initial classification results is improved by reducing errors, minimizing noise. There is a significant gain in the overall accuracy and interpretability of the final output. For these reasons, most authors recommend that post-processing methods be applied to the result of machine learning classifiers \citep{Schindler2012}.

Most post-processing methods use the ``smoothness assumption'' \citep{Schindler2012}: nearby pixels tend to have the same label. Probability-based smoothing methods include Gaussian and edge-aware filtering \citep{Schindler2012}, modal filters \citep{Ghimire2010}, and probabilistic relaxation \citep{Gong1989}. \citet{Huang2014} propose a relearning method based on co-occurrence matrices; these matrices represent the joint distribution of class labels in the neighborhood of each pixel.

In this paper, we introduce the \texttt{bayesEO} package which provides a new method for image post-processing based on Bayesian statistics. The algorithm uses the neighbourhood information to remove outliers and enhance consistency in the resulting map. Bayesian inference can be thought of as way of coherently update our uncertainty in the light of new evidence. It can consider expert knowledge on the derivation of probabilities. As stated by \citet{Spiegelhalter2009}: ``In the Bayesian paradigm, degrees of belief in states of nature are specified. Bayesian statistical methods start with existing `prior' beliefs, and update these using data to give `posterior' beliefs, which may be used as the basis for inferential decisions''.

Bayesian smoothing methods have become an established technique for image restoration and reconstruction \citep{Hanson1993}. More recently, \citet{Wu2017} proposed a Bayesian
approach for soft fusion applied to change detection. However, to the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first proposal to use Bayesian smoothing for post-processing of machine
learning image classification.

In \proglang{R}, \ldots include here a discussion of what's available in R, and
include mention to the \pkg{sits} package.

\subsection{Conversion from probabilities to logits}\label{conversion-from-probabilities-to-logits}}

The proposed post-classification smoothing model considers the output of a machine learning algorithm that provides the probabilities of each pixel in the image to belong to target classes. More formally, let \(p_{i,k}\) \textgreater= 0 be the probability of pixel \(i\) belonging to class \(k\), \(k=1,\dots{},K\), where K is the number of classes, then

\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^K p_{i,k} = 1.
\end{equation}

To make the inference tractable, the class probability values \(p_{i,k}\) are converted to log-odds values. The logit function converts probability values in the interval \([0,1]\) to logit values in \([-\infty, \infty]\), expressed by

\begin{equation}
x_{i,k} = \ln \left(\frac{p_{i,k}}{1 - p_{i,k}}\right).
\end{equation}

Confidence in pixel classification increases with logit. There are situations, such as border pixels or mixed ones, where the logit of different classes are similar in magnitude. These are cases of low confidence in the classification result. To assess and correct these cases, the post-classification smoothing method borrows strength from the neighbors.

\hypertarget{bayesian-inference}{%
\subsection{Bayesian inference}\label{bayesian-inference}}

After transforming probability values into logits, the problem can be expressed in a Bayesian context. Suppose that \(x\in{}X\) has a distribution \(\pi(x|\theta)\) with an unknown \(\theta{}\in{}\Theta{}\) parameter. Consider two random variables for each pixel \(i\) and class \(k\): (a) \(x_{i,k}\), the observed class logits; (b) \(\mu_{i,k}\), the inferred logit values based on the observations. From the output of the machine learning classification is \(x_{i,k}\), the aim is to estimate the actual values \(\mu_{i,k} | x_{i,k}\). The Bayesian inference procedure can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\pi(\mu|x) \propto{} \pi(x|\mu)\pi(\mu).
\end{equation}

To estimate the conditional posterior distribution \(\pi(\mu|x)\), we combine two distributions: (a) the distribution \(\pi(x|\mu)\), known as the likelihood, which expresses how measured values \(x_{i,k}\) depend in the underlying values \(\mu_{i,k}\); and (b) \(\pi(\mu)\), which is our guess on the actual data distribution, known as the prior. For simplicity, independence between the different classes \(k\) is assumed. Therefore, the update will be performed for each class \(k\) separately.

The method assumes that the likelihood \(x_{i,k} | \mu_{i,k}\) follows a normal distribution \(N(\mu_{i,k}, \sigma^2_{k})\), with parameters \(\mu_{i,k}\) and \(\sigma^2_{k}\). The variance \(\sigma^2_{k}\) will be estimated based on user expertise and taken as a hyperparameter to control the smoothness of the resulting estimate. Therefore

\begin{equation}
x_{i,k} | \mu_{i,k} \sim N(\mu_{i,k}, \sigma^2_{k})
\end{equation}

is the likelihood. We will also assume a normal local prior for the parameter \(\mu_{i,k}\) with parameters \(m_{i,k}\) and \(s^2_{i,k}\):

\begin{equation}
    \mu_{i,k} \sim N(m_{i,k}, s^2_{i,k}).
\end{equation}

To calculate the prior, the method assumes that the class probabilities in the spatial neighborhood of the pixel have the same distribution. Estimating the local means and variances for the prior distribution considers a spatial neighborhood \(N_{i}\) close to pixel \(p_i\). Let \(\#(N_{i})\) be the number of elements in the neighborhood \(N_{i}\). The mean value is given by

\begin{equation}
m_{i,k} = \frac{\sum_{(j) \in N_{i}} x_{j,k}}{\#(N_{i})}
\end{equation}

and the variance by

\begin{equation}
s^2_{i,k} = \frac{\sum_{(j) \in N_{i}} [x_{j,k} - m_{i,k}]^2}{\#(N_{i})-1}.
\end{equation}

Given these assumptions, the Bayesian update for the expected conditional mean
\({E}[\mu_{i,k} | x_{i,k}]\) is given by:

\begin{equation}
{E}[\mu_{i,k} | x_{i,k}] = \frac{m_{i,t} \times \sigma^2_{k} +
x_{i,k} \times s^2_{i,k}}{ \sigma^2_{k} +s^2_{i,k}},
\end{equation}

which can be expressed as a weighted mean

\begin{equation}
{E}[\mu_{i,k} | x_{i,k}] =
\Biggl [ \frac{s^2_{i,k}}{\sigma^2_{k} +s^2_{i,k}} \Biggr ] \times
x_{i,k} +
\Biggl [ \frac{\sigma^2_{k}}{\sigma^2_{k} +s^2_{i,k}} \Biggr ] \times m_{i,k},
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item $x_{i,k}$ is the logit value for pixel $i$ and class $k$.
\item $m_{i,k}$ is the average of logit values for pixels of class $k$ 
in the neighborhood of pixel $i$.
\item $s^2_{i,k}$ is the variance of logit values for pixels of class $k$ 
in the neighborhood of pixel $i$.
\item $\sigma^2_{k}$ is the likelihood variance for class $k$, 
an user-derived hyperparameter.
\end{itemize}

The above equation is a weighted average between the value \(x_{i,k}\) for the pixel and the mean \(m_{i,k}\) for the neighboring pixels. When the variance \(s^2_{i,k}\) for the neighbors is too high, the algorithm gives more weight to the pixel value \(x_{i,k}\). When the variance of the likelihood \(\sigma^2_k\) increases, the method gives more weight to the neighborhood mean \(m_{i,k}\).

\newpage

\hypertarget{effect-of-the-hyperparameter}{%
\subsection{Effect of the hyperparameter}\label{effect-of-the-hyperparameter}}

The parameter \(\sigma^2_k\) controls the level of smoothness. If \(\sigma^2_k\) is zero, the estimated value \({E}[\mu_{i,k} | x_{i,k}]\) will be the pixel value \(x_{i,k}\). Values of the likelihood variance \(\sigma^2_{k}\), which are small relative to the prior variance \(s^2_{i,k}\) increase our confidence in the original probabilities. Conversely, likelihood variances \(\sigma^2_{k}\), which are large relative to the prior variance \(s^2_{i,k}\), increase our confidence in the average probability of the neighborhood.

Thus, the parameter \(\sigma^2_{k}\) expresses confidence in the inherent variability of the distribution of values of a class \(k\). The smaller the parameter \(\sigma^2_{k}\), the more we trust the estimated probability values produced by the classifier for class \(k\).
Conversely, higher values of \(\sigma^2_{k}\) indicate lower confidence in the classifier outputs and improved confidence in the local average values.

Consider the following two-class example. Take a pixel with probability \(0.4\) (logit \(x_{i,1} = -0.4054\)) for class A, and probability \(0.6\) (logit \(x_{i,2} = 0.4054\)) for class B. Without post-processing, the pixel will be labelled as class B. Consider a local average of \(0.6\) (logit \(m_{i,1} = 0.4054\)) for class A and \(0.4\) (logit \(m_{i,2} = -0.4054\)) for class B. This is an outlier classified as class B in the midst of a set of pixels of class A. Suppose a local variance of logits to be \(s^2_{i,1} = 5\) for class A and \(s^2_{i,2} = 10\) and for class B. This difference is to be expected if the local variability of class A is smaller than that of class B. To complete the estimate, we need to set the parameter \(\sigma^2_{k}\), representing prior belief in the variability of the probability values for each class. If we take both \(\sigma^2_{A}\) for class A and \(\sigma^2_{B}\) for class B to be both 10, the Bayesian estimated probability for class A is \(0.52\) and for class B is \(0.48\). In this case, the pixel will be relabeled as being class A. If we set \(\sigma^2\) to be 5 for both classes A and B, the Bayesian probability estimate will be \(0.48\) for class A and \(0.52\) for class B. In this case, the original class will be kept.

\hypertarget{defining-the-neighbourhood}{%
\subsection{Defining the neighbourhood}\label{defining-the-neighbourhood}}

The underlying principle of Bayesian smoothing is that regions with similar characteristics typically have a dominant class, characterized by higher average probabilities and lower variance compared to other classes. In such areas, a pixel belonging to a different class is expected to exhibit lower average probabilities and higher local variance. Consequently, post-processing should alter the class of this pixel to match the dominant class.

Classification challenges arise when pixels are situated along the boundaries between areas containing different classes, as they possess signatures of two classes. To ensure the reliability of local class statistics, only pixels with a high likelihood of belonging to the class should be included. In the context of spatial neighborhoods centered on border pixels, only a portion of the pixels in the window share the same class as the central pixel, while the others belong to a different class. To account for border pixels, we use a specialized definition of a neighborhood to estimate the prior class distribution.

To approximate the prior distribution using spatial neighborhoods, the algorithm uses pixels with high probability of belonging to the class. The rationale is that pixels with low probabilities are unlikely to be part of the same class distribution as those with high probability values. This procedure ensures a more reliable estimation of the prior.

\hypertarget{reading-a-probability-data-cube}{%
\subsection{Reading a probability data cube}\label{reading-a-probability-data-cube}}

The input for post-classification is an image with probabilities produced by a machine learning algorithm. This file should be multi-band, where each band contains the pixel probabilities of a single class. The file name must have information on reference dates and include a version number. In the examples, we use a file produced by a random forests algorithm applied to a data cube of Sentinel-2 images for tile ``20LLQ'' in the period 2020-06-04 to 2021-08-26. The image has been stored as INT2S data type with integer values between {[}0..10000{]} to represent probabilities ranging from 0 ro 1.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> data_dir <- system.file("/extdata/Rondonia-20LLQ/", package = "sitsdata")
R> probs_file <- list.files(data_dir)
R> probs_file
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
[1] "SENTINEL-2_MSI_20LLQ_2020-06-04_2021-08-26_probs_v1.tif"
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The training data has six classes: (a) \code{Forest} for natural tropical forest; (b) \code{Water} for lakes and rivers; (c) \code{Wetlands} for areas where water covers the soil in the wet season; (d) \code{ClearCut_Burn} for areas where fires cleared the land after tree removal. (e) \code{ClearCut_Soil} where the forest has been removed; (f) \code{ClearCut_Veg} where some vegetation remains after most trees have been removed. The class labels should also be informed by the user, since they are not stored in image files.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> labels <- c("Water", "ClearCut_Burn", "ClearCut_Soil",
+             "ClearCut_Veg", "Forest", "Wetland")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The following code reads the file using the \code{terra} package.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> probs_image <- terra::rast(paste0(data_dir,"/",probs_file))
R> names(probs_image) <- labels
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The output is a \code{SpatRaster} object from the \code{terra} package. Figure \ref{fig:pcube} shows the plot of all layer of the probability image. The map for class \code{Forest} shows high probability values associated with compact patches and linear stretches in riparian areas. Class \code{ClearCut_Soil} is mostly composed of dense areas of high probability whose geometrical boundaries result from forest cuts. By contrast, the probability maps for classes \code{Water}, \code{ClearCut_Burn}, and \code{ClearCut_Veg} have mostly low values. Note that we need to inform the scaling parameter that converts the image to {[}0..1{]} interval.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> bayes_plot(probs_image, scale = 0.0001)

\caption[Class probabilities produced by random forest algorithm]{Class probabilities produced by random forest algorithm.}\label{fig:pcube}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The non-smoothed labeled map shows the need for post-processing. This map is obtained by taking the class of higher probability to each pixel, without considering the spatial context. This is done by \code{bayes_label()} whose parameter is a \code{SpatRaster} object containing the probabilities of each class for all pixels.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> map_no_smooth <- bayes_label(probs_image)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Figure \ref{fig:map1} shows the resulting map, which contains a significant number of outliers and misclassified pixels.

\hypertarget{estimating-the-local-logit-variances}{%
\subsection{Estimating the local logit variances}\label{estimating-the-local-logit-variances}}

The local logit variances correspond to the \(s^2_{i,k}\) parameter in the Bayesian inference and are estimated by \code{sits_variance()}. Its main parameters are: (a) a \code{SpatRaster} object ; (b) \code{window_size}, dimension of the local neighbourhood; (c) \code{neigh_fraction}, the percentage of pixels in the neighbourhood used to calculate the variance. The example below uses half of the pixels of a \(7\times 7\) window to estimate the variance. The chosen pixels will be those with the highest probability pixels to be more representative of the actual class distribution. The output values are the logit variances in the vicinity of each pixel.

\begin{CodeChunk}

The choice of the \(7 \times 7\) window size is a compromise between having enough values to
estimate the parameters of a normal distribution and the need to capture local effects
for class patches of small sizes. Classes such as \code{Water} and \code{ClearCut_Burn}
tend to be spatially limited; a bigger window size could result in invalid values for
their respective normal distributions.

The summary statistics show that most local variance values are low, which is an expected result. Areas of low variance correspond to pixel neighborhoods of high logit values for one of the classes and low logit values for the others. High values of the local variances are relevant in areas of confusion between classes. Figure \ref{fig:vcube} shows the values of local logit variances for classes \code{ClearCut_Soil} and \code{Forest}, considering only the \(4^{th}\) quartile of the distribution. Only the top 25\% of the values for each class are shown, emphasizing areas of high local variability.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> bayes_plot(var_image, quantile = 0.75, labels = c("ClearCut_Soil", "Forest"))
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption[Logit variance map showing values above the 3rd quartile]{Logit variance map showing values above the 3rd quartile.}\label{fig:vcube}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Comparing the logit variance maps of Figure \ref{fig:vcube} with the probability maps of Figure \ref{fig:pcube} emphasizes the relevance of expert knowledge. The areas of high probability of class \code{Forest} are mostly made of compact patches; areas of high local variance occur near the borders of these patches. By contrast, class \code{ClearCut_Veg} represents a transition between natural forest areas and places where all trees have been cut, which are associated to class \code{ClearCut_Soil}. Class \code{ClearCut_Veg} has a high spectral variability, since the extent of remaining vegetation after most trees have been removed is not uniform. For this reason, the local variance of class \code{ClearCut_Veg} is mostly patch-based, while that of class \code{Forest} is mostly border-based.

Further insights are provided by Figure \ref{fig:vhist}, which shows the histograms of local variances per class. The values shown correspond to the \(4^{th}\) quartile (top 25\% of all values). The distribution of logit variances is uneven between the classes. Class \code{ClearCut_Veg} has a more balanced distribution, while most values in the \(4^{th}\) quartile of class \code{ClearCut_Soil} have low values.

\hypertarget{applying-bayesian-smoothing-to-remove-outliers}{%
\subsection{Applying Bayesian smoothing to remove outliers}\label{applying-bayesian-smoothing-to-remove-outliers}}

To remove the outliers in the classification map, \pkg{bayesEO} provides \code{bayes_smooth()}. Its main parameters are: (a) \code{x}, a probability image; (b) \code{window_size}, dimension of the local neighborhood; (c) \code{neigh_fraction}, percentage of pixels in the neighborhood used to calculate the variance; (d) \code{smoothness}, prior logit variances for each class.

As discussed above, the effect of the Bayesian estimator depends on the values of the a priori variance \(\sigma^2_{k}\) set by the user and the neighborhood definition to compute the local variance \(s^2_{i,1}\) for each pixel. To show the effects of different \(\sigma^2\) values we consider two cases: (a) setting \(\sigma^2\) to a high value close to the maximum value of local logit variance; (b) setting \(\sigma^2\) to a lower value close to the minimum value of the \(4^{th}\) quartile.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> smooth_high <- bayes_smooth(
+     probs_image,
+     window_size = 7,
+     neigh_fraction = 0.5,
+     smoothness = c(25, 10, 20, 20, 25, 10)
+ )
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The impact of Bayesian smoothing can be best captured by producing a labelled map using \code{sits_label_classification()}, taking the smoothed image as its input. Figure \ref{fig:smth1} shows that the outliers and isolated pixels have been removed.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> map_smooth_high <- bayes_label(smooth_high)
R> bayes_map(map_smooth_high)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics{Bayesian_smoothing_JSS_files/figure-latex/smth1-1} 

}

\caption[Labeled map with smoothing with high smoothness values]{Labeled map with smoothing with high smoothness values.}\label{fig:smth1}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

In the smoothed map, the outliers have been removed by expanding \code{Forest} areas. Forests have replaced small corridors of water and soil encircled by trees. This effect is due to the high probability of forest detection in the training data. Compare the smoothing with high values with the smoothing with values close to the minimum value of the \(4^{th}\) quartile of the local variance for each class, as computed below.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> smooth_low <- bayes_smooth(
+     probs_image,
+     window_size = 7,
+     neigh_fraction = 0.5,
+     smoothness = c(5, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1)
+ )
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

To see the impact of small \(\sigma^2\), we compute the labeled map.

\begin{CodeChunk}

R> map_smooth_low <- bayes_label(smooth_low)
R> bayes_map(map_smooth_low)

A visual comparison between the two smoothed maps shows that there is an increase in the area of the \code{ClearCut_Veg} class. Such observation is confirmed by comparing the class areas of the non-smoothed map with the two types of smoothed maps, as shown below.

In the smoothed map with higher prior variance values, the most frequent classes (\code{ClearCut_Soil} and \code{Forest}) increased their areas at the expense of the others. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:pcube}, these classes occur in more compact patches than the others. In the second smoothed map, there is an increase in the area occupied by the \code{ClearCutVeg} class. This increase is due to the nature of this class, which represents a transition between a natural tropical area and one where all trees have been removed. Depending on the aims and practices of those responsible for deforestation, these areas may either have their tree cover removed completely. There are cases, however, where these places are abandoned and turn into secondary vegetation areas \cite{Uhl1988, Wang2020}.

This example shows the value of the Bayesian inference procedure compared with smoothing methods such as Gaussian and edge-aware filtering \citep{Schindler2012}. Most post-classification procedures use ad-hoc parameters which are not directly linked to the properties of the data. These parameters are based on the structure of the algorithm (e.g, size of the Gaussian kernel), not being easily defined separately for each class. Bayesian inference allows the expert to control the output.

Based on the experience of the authors with different experts on land use classification, there are two main approaches for setting the \(\sigma^2_{k}\) parameter:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Increase the neighborhood influence compared with the probability values for each pixel, setting high values (20 or above) to \(\sigma^2_{k}\) and increasing the neighborhood window size. Classes whose probabilities have strong spatial autocorrelation will tend to replace outliers.
\item
  Reduce the neighborhood influence compared with the probabilities for each pixel of class \(k\), setting low values (five or less) to \(\sigma^2_{k}\). In this way, classes with low spatial autocorrelation are more likely to keep their original labels.
\end{enumerate}

Consider the case of forest areas and watersheds. If an expert wishes to have compact areas classified as forests without many outliers inside them, she will set the \(\sigma^2\) parameter for the class \code{Forest} to be high. For comparison, to avoid that small watersheds with few similar neighbors being relabeled, it is advisable to avoid a strong influence of the neighbors, setting \(\sigma^2\) to be as low as possible. Therefore, the choice of \(\sigma^2\) depends on the effect intended by the expert in the final classified map.
